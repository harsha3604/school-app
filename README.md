# MY FIRST PROJECT
* This is my first django project.
* It is a simple quiz app for teachers and students.
* Teachers can CRUD questions. Students can attempt a quiz and see their results.
* In order to use the app, simply pull the contents to a new folder, and using the following terminal commands:
  - cd "Your new folder path"
    - python3 manage.py runserver

Suggestions are welcome.


## Update 1.1
* Students can take any one of the 4 subject quizzes: English, Science, Maths and Geography.
* Teacher assigned to a subject can perform CRUD operations on questions related to that subject only.
  - For example: A science teacher can only view questions related to science subject.
