This is my first django project.

It is a simple quiz app for teachers and students.

Teachers can CRUD questions. Students can attempt a quiz and see their results.

In order to use the app, simply pull the contents to a new folder, and using the following terminal commands.

cd "Your folder name"
python3 manage.py runserver


Suggestions are welcome.
